TrueVault for Meteor
=============================

Forked from woddy:truevault
- Added vaults with different roles for clinicians and patients

Use the TrueVault REST API easily with Meteor.

# Setup
1. Sign up for TrueVault and create a Vault and a User. **Tip:** Follow these instruction - https://www.truevault.com/documentation/quick-start.html
2. Add the package to your app `meteor add woody:truevault`
3. On the **server**, include the following configuration:

```
Meteor.startup(function(){
  TrueVault.config({
    "API_KEY": "PASTE_YOUR_KEY",
    "VAULT_ID": "PASTE_YOUR_VAULT_ID"
  });
});

// Add a default record to be stored on TrueVault after a user is created
Accounts.onCreateUser(function (options, user) {
  TrueVault.insert({
    default: "Default Value"
  }, user._id, user._id);

  // Keep the default hook's 'profile' behavior.
  if (options.profile){
    user.profile = options.profile;
  }
  return user;
});
```

# Overview

This package requires an **accounts system**. The pattern used is one TrueVault document per Meteor user. On the client and the server, there is a `Collection` called `Vault`, which contains the TrueVault mapping for the Meteor user. The `Vault` collection on the client will only contain the record for the currently logged in user. There are **two ways** to use this package, the suggested (easy) way or a custom (advanced) way for different use cases. Both ways are summarized below. Also, SSL must be used in production - `meteor add force-ssl`.


### The Suggested (Easy) Way

Interact via the provided **client-only** collection called `TrueVault`. This collection will contain a mirror of the actual document stored in TrueVault for the currently logged in user. After you update this client-only collection with a standard `TrueVault.update()` call, the updated record will be sent and stored on TrueVault automatically. Make sure you are creating a default record after a user is created like shown in the setup `Accounts.onCreateUser` function above.

### The Custom (Advanced) Way

Use the TrueVault object on the server to do things like `TrueVault.insert(doc, userId)`. Use the simple server API documented below. More care must be taken if this method is chosen.


# API - Client

### TrueVault

A standard Meteor Mongo Collection. Contains a mirror of the currently logged in users TrueVault record. When you do something like `TrueVault.update()`, the updates are automatically sent and stored on real TrueVault.

### Vault

A standard Meteor Mongo Collection. Contains the TrueVault mapping for the currently logged in user: 
```
clinicianId: String, 
patientId: String, 
document_id: String,
version: Number
```

The `version` is incremented each time `TrueVault.update()` is successfully called on the server. Whenever the version number changes, the client fetches the new updates. While updating or fetching updates, a `Session` variable is set to `true`. You can use the value with `Session.get('isTrueVaultUpdating')`, but don't set it.


# API - Server

### TrueVault

An object with a number of useful methods:

#### TrueVault.insert(doc, clinicianId, patientId)

The `doc` arg should be a standard JavaScript object to store on TrueVault. The `userId` is used to save the mapping in the `Vault` collection.

#### TrueVault.findOne(document_id)

Return the document on TrueVault based on the `document_id` that is passed.

#### TrueVault.update(document_id, doc)

The `document_id` is the selector, and the `doc` argument is what to update the **entire** record to. The entire record will be replaced by the passed `doc`.

#### TrueVault.remove(document_id)

Removes the specified document on TrueVault. This should be used with extreme care.

#### TrueVault.config(obj)

Extends the `settings` property on the server TrueVault object.

#### TrueVault.settings

An object that should have the following properties:
```
API_ENDPOINT: (set by default, do not override)
API_KEY: (set in the config call as documented in Setup above)
API_VAULTID: (set in the config call as documented in Setup above)
```


### Meteor Methods
Ex: `Meteor.call('METHOD_NAME', args)`

#### findOneTrueVault

Returns the logged in users TrueVault record. Takes no arguments.

#### updateTrueVault

Takes one argument, a JavaScript object, and updates the logged in users entire TrueVault document to the passed object.


### Roadmap

1. ~~Simple way to store and retrieve user records in TrueVault.~~
2. ~~Make compatible with `audit-arguments-check` package.~~
3. Integrate TrueVault Blob API.

#### Please Note:

HIPAA compliance is highly complex. This Meteor package cannot guarantee you will be compliant. Please consult experts to make sure you are doing this correctly. This package is not officially supported by TrueVault.
